# Natural Language Toolkit
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical 
resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, 
wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.
